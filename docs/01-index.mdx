Welcome to the Discord4J documentation! Discord4J is a [reactive](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) Java wrapper for
the official [Discord Bot API](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro). This site will cover all the basics on
reactive programming, how to utilize the Discord4J library effectively, and common examples in reactive and blocking
contexts. Feel free to explore the various topics these docs cover using the links in the sidebar.

These docs roughly follow the [Di√°taxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/) for documentation. This means the articles are
divided into four categories:
* **Tutorials**: "Can you teach me to...?"
* **How-to guides**: "How do I...?"
* **Reference**: "What is...?"
* **Explanation**: "Why...?"

We're always looking to improve, so if you have trouble finding something, or think we're missing useful
information/examples, please make sure to [open an issue](https://github.com/Discord4J/documentation).
