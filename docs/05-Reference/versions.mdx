The following table describes our current available versions, their support status, Discord API versions and
compatibility with other projects like Spring Boot.

| Discord4J                                                    | Support          | Gateway/API  | Intents   | Reactor           | Spring Boot   | Artifact VERSION |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------ | --------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| [v3.3.x](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/tree/master) | In development   | v9 (Threads) | Mandatory | 3.4 (2020)        | 2.3 and above | [Snapshots only](/using-snapshots) |
| [v3.2.x](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/tree/3.2.x)  | Current          | v8           | Mandatory | 3.4 (2020)        | 2.3 and above | [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.discord4j/discord4j-core/3.2.svg?label=&style=flat-square)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.discord4j/discord4j-core) |
| [v3.1.x](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/tree/3.1.x)  | Maintenance Only | v6           | Optional  | 3.3 (Dysprosium)  | 2.2 and above | [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.discord4j/discord4j-core/3.1.svg?label=&style=flat-square)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.discord4j/discord4j-core) |

Discord API v8 and above require mandatory intents, Discord4J uses [non-privileged intents](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#privileged-intents) by default.

All supported versions have JDK 8 baseline. Spring Boot compatibility is a general guideline as other versions might
work through shading techniques for transitive libraries like Reactor and Netty.

"Maintenance only" support means we'll try to address critical issues only but no new features will be added to that
branch.

If you want to use experimental snapshot versions, refer to [Using Snapshots](/using-snapshots).

## Compatibility

Discord4J uses a `Generation.Major.Minor` version scheme so the following guidelines apply:

- Upgrades from a `x.y.z` to `x.y.z+1` version don't affect public API and behavior changes are not expected unless they
  mean to fix a major issue.
- Upgrades from a `x.y` to `x.y+1` generally need a migration guide as they can have public API changes. We will try to
  offer a migration period of at least 1 major version whenever possible.

Classes and methods marked as **Beta** or **Experimental** are not affected by this policy.
