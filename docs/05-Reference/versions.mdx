All supported versions have JDK 8 baseline. Spring Boot compatibility is a general guideline as other versions might
work through shading techniques for transitive libraries like Reactor and Netty.

"Maintenance only" support means we'll try to address critical issues only but no new features will be added to that
branch.

If you want to use experimental snapshot versions , refer to [Using Snapshots](using-snapshots).

## Compatibility

Discord4J uses a `Generation.Major.Minor` version scheme so the following guidelines apply:

- Upgrades from a `x.y.z` to `x.y.z+1` version don't affect public API and behavior changes are not expected unless they
  mean to fix a major issue.
- Upgrades from a `x.y` to `x.y+1` generally need a migration guide as they can have public API changes. We will try to
  offer a migration period of at least 1 major version whenever possible.

Classes and methods marked as Beta or Experimental are not affected by this policy.
