## Maintenance mode for v3.1

After v3.2.0 releases, only bugfixes will be accepted in the 3.1.x branch.

## Features

### New entity cache abstraction: `Store`

While developing v3.1.x some limitations were encountered if trying to implement a custom entity cache pursuing
efficiency, as a given abstraction to organize data was fixed on implementations ("9-Store layout"), that forced
cache operations around a generic find/save set of operations, without taking into consideration the relational aspect
some entities have and could be leveraged for improved performance.

To address this and other problems, an abstraction named `Store` is introduced in [#788](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/pull/788)
around a command-oriented pattern by requiring a single method: `execute(StoreAction)`. This method is responsible for
receiving both Gateway updates and user-facing queries, giving implementations no restrictions, but tools that help with the process.

Some of the most notable components added:

- `StoreLayout`: the minimal set of methods that are required to support a Discord cache: Gateway updates, and data-access queries
- `ActionMapper`: a registry for `StoreAction` instances passed to the `Store`
- `ReadActions`: all queries placed in a convenient class, to build actions
- `DispatchStoreLayer`: introduce caching capabilities to users operating exclusively with the `gateway` module

Regarding project organization, `Store` now lives in the `discord4j-common` module, dropping the dependency on `stores-api`.
This also means structures like `StateHolder` and `StateView` are no longer present. Check the [migration guide](/migrating-from-v3-1-to-v3-2#directly-querying-a-store) for details.

### New immutable spec API

After receiving feedback regarding `Consumer`-based request builders, a new set of APIs were introduced in [#927](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/pull/927),
aiming to help with API request building. Multiple patterns are available so please check the [Specs](specs) page for more information.

### Preparing for threads

In order to easily migrate to a new channel hierarchy supporting threads, some changes were applied to v3.2 [deprecating](#deprecations-for-threads-in-3-1)
methods that won't be available in v3.3 after thread channels are implemented in [#923](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/pull/923).

## API changes

### Signature changes

- Slash command methods that previously took `WebhookMultipartRequest` now take `MultipartRequest<WebhookExecuteRequest>` and can be built using one of its static factory methods

- ChangeKey.ROLES_ADD and ChangeKey.ROLES_REMOVE type change from `ChangeKey<Set<Role>>` to `ChangeKey<Set<AuditLogRole>>` to properly reflect the data type returned from Discord. Contains `id` and `name`.

- Due to immutable specs [#927](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J/pull/927), Consumer-based `XXSpec` classes are now located at `discord4j.core.spec.legacy` package and renamed to `LegacyXXSpec`. They are deprecated to encourage usage of the new patterns, and might be removed in a future release
