## Introduction

Specs, short for Specification(s), are the way Discord4J encapsulates API request parameter building from our core module. They can handle requests that contain multiple _optional_ properties.

There are multiple ways of interacting with them and building them, starting from v3.2.

## New immutable Specs (v3.2)

### Fluent Mono request

An API request without parameters is a `Mono` that can be subscribed or composed to perform the request.

```java
channel.createMessage("Hey")
    .withComponents(ActionRow.of(Button.success("hey", "Click me!")))
    .subscribe();
```

Remember that nothing happens until you subscribe! This can be used to your advantage by reusing the `Mono` pipeline you build after each `withX`.

### Spec with copy methods

An immutable `Spec` that can be shared across components and used for templating. Each `with` call copies the previous instance to maintain immutability and ensure thread-safety.

```java
MessageCreateSpec spec = MessageCreateSpec.create()
    .withContent("Hey")
    .withComponents(ActionRow.of(Button.success("hey", "Click me!")));

channel.createMessage(spec).subscribe();
```

### Builder pattern

A more traditional builder pattern approach. Make sure you call `builder` on the right spec for an instance you can configure to your liking.


```java
MessageCreateSpec spec = MessageCreateSpec.builder()
        .content("Hey")
        .addComponent(ActionRow.of(Button.success("hey", "Click me!")))
        .build();

channel.createMessage(spec).subscribe();
```

## Consumer-based Specs

Prior to Discord4J v3.2 this was the only alternative to building requests, it follows two principles:

1. The end-user does **not** construct the builder.
2. The end-user does **not** construct the finalized object.

These two characteristics provide Discord4J with a flexible approach regarding constructing requests, without breaking the API at a future date.

### Example

All Specs that an end user interacts with will be provided via a `Consumer`. For example, for `MessageChannel#createMessage`:

```java
messageChannel.createMessage(spec -> /* manipulate the spec */)
```

One may note that all `Spec` instances have an `asRequest` method. This method is an internal behaviorally implementation-specific method and should never be called by the end-user. Once the Spec has been "built", simply leave it alone.

```java
Mono<Message> message = messageChannel.createMessage(messageSpec -> {
    messageSpec.setContent("Content not in an embed!");
    // You can see in this example, even with simple singular property defining specs
    // the syntax is concise
    messageSpec.setEmbed(embedSpec ->
        embedSpec.setDescription("Description is in an embed!")
    );
});
```

### Templates

:::note
For templates, it is more convenient to use the new immutable specs.
:::

Using `Consumer#andThen` allows this pattern to be implemented:

```java
Consumer<EmbedCreateSpec> template = spec -> {
    // Edit the spec as you normally would
};
...
// embedSpec can be edited as you normally would, but the edits from template will
// already be applied
Mono<Message> message = messageChannel.createMessage(messageSpec ->
    messageSpec.setEmbed(template.andThen(embedSpec -> {}))
);
```

This pattern additionally helps protect the end-user from accidentally sharing specs across multiple invocations, as the state is never "reset" and mutating these legacy `Spec` instances is **not** thread-safe.
