## Core classes

### DiscordClient

Main REST API wrapper, and an entry point to spawn Gateway connections. Can be obtained by calling `getClient().rest()` from most objects.

### CoreResources

A mediator for resources essential to operate on `DiscordClient`, like the `RestClient`, `JacksonResources` and `ReactorResources`.

### GatewayDiscordClient

Discord Gateway is the websocket connection receiving real-time updates. Starting from v3.1 we call `GatewayDiscordClient` to the manager of all resources and state regarding a shard group. Connections are maintained by it and is capable of giving access to cached entities from updates. Can be obtained by calling `getClient()` from most objects.

### GatewayBootstrap

A builder to create a `GatewayDiscordClient`. The place where resources and many configurations are set before connecting to Discord Gateway. Defaults are used to enable built-in sharding and can be customized in many ways.

### GatewayClient

Keeps all state regarding a **single** shard lifecycle, providing automatic reconnections and forwarding updates to the parent `GatewayDiscordClient`.

### GatewayResources

A mediator for most resources required by a `GatewayClient` to operate. The rest are provided during `GatewayBootstrap` setup and are used to build `GatewayOptions`.

### GatewayOptions

The set of configuration passed to a `GatewayClient` in order to be created.

### ShardCoordinator

A manager in charge of relaying lifecycle events for sharding. It is used to notify clients that shards are identifying, connecting or disconnecting to allow for distributed application scenarios where the notification may be relayed across boundaries.

### Store

Starting from v3.2, a Store is the central component for all entity caching from the real-time Gateway, it receives updates from the connected shard group.

### EventDispatcher

Publishes Gateway events to your bot application. Since v3.1 the events are coming from all shards in a shard group, so a single instance is enough for a `GatewayDiscordClient`.

### ReactorResources

Encapsulates Reactor Netty HttpClient and Scheduler for blocking and timed tasks, can be customized.

### JacksonResources

Jackson ObjectMapper configured specifically for Discord4J, can be customized.

### RouterFactory and Router

Factory to create a `Router` which performs REST API requests. Can be customized to coordinate multiple instances.
