## Application Commands

:::note
For information on how to use application commands, see [here](/interactions/application-commands).
:::

Application commands encompass several types of interactions:
* A chat input command (formerly "slash command"), which allows users to type a command in the chat box.
* Message command, which allows right-clicking on a message and using a context menu interaction (ex. "star message").
* Or User command, which allows right-clicking on a user and using a context menu interaction (ex. "temp mute").

In order for guilds to use application commands your bot has created, it is required that the bot be invited with the `applications.commands` scope in addition to the `bot` scope.

Application commands can be registered globally (accessible to all guilds that your bot is invited to), or per-guild; allowing each guild to have their own unique commands as they see fit.


### Chat Input (Slash Commands)

#### Options
Chat input commands can have `options`. These are just like arguments in a method, but for discord commands.

#### Option Types
Discord provides several built in types for options that define how each of them behave and their data type.

| Name              | Value | Note                                                             |
|-------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SUB_COMMAND       | 1     |                                                                  |
| SUB_COMMAND_GROUP | 2     | Transparent to the user; a way to organize your commands in code |
| STRING            | 3     |                                                                  |
| INTEGER           | 4     | Any integer between -2^53 and 2^53                               |
| BOOLEAN           | 5     |                                                                  |
| USER              | 6     |                                                                  |
| CHANNEL           | 7     | Includes all channel types + categories                          |
| ROLE              | 8     |                                                                  |
| MENTIONABLE       | 9     | Includes all users/roles                                         |
| NUMBER            | 10    | Any floating point number between -2^53 and 2^53                 |

#### Choices

Choices can be defined on the `STRING`, `INTEGER`, and `NUMBER` option types. `choices` are preset values the user can pick when selecting the option that contains them.

:::caution
If you specify choices for an option, these are the only valid values a user may pick.
:::

### Message Commands

Message commands are a type of application command that is visible in the right click context menu of a message.

Message commands, unlike chat input, do not support options or descriptions.

### User Commands

User commands are a type of application command that is visible in the right click context menu of a user.

User commands, unlike chat input, do not support options or descriptions.

## Buttons

:::note
For information on how to use buttons, see [here](/interactions/buttons).
:::

Buttons are interactive components on a Message. Similar to the old-school reaction buttons, these provide cleaner UI/UX than a small reaction button and are the preferred way of handling such inputs now.

Buttons must be inside an `ActionRow`

:::caution
You can have up to 5 `ActionRow`s per message, and up to 5 `Button`s within each `ActionRow`.
:::

### Button Styles

Button styles offer a number of ways for a button to display

| Style     | Description                            |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| PRIMARY   | A blurple button                       |
| SECONDARY | A grey button                          |
| SUCCESS   | A green button                         |
| DANGER    | A red button                           |
| LINK      | A grey button, that navigates to a URL |

:::caution
`LINK` style buttons cannot have a `custom_id` and will not send an interaction event when a user clicks on it.
:::

### Disabled buttons

Buttons can be disabled to prevent user interaction. When set to `disabled` the button will appear grayed out.

### Emoji Buttons

Buttons can also display an emoji rather than text if desired
