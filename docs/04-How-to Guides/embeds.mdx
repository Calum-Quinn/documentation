You've likely seen embeds before. They're a great way to display information to a user in a clean way.

In this section we will cover how to create and customize embeds.

## Preview

Here is an example of what embeds can look like.

## Building the Embed

Discord4J uses [Immutable Specs](/specs) to build objects, for to build embeds we use `EmbedCreatSpec.builder()`.

```java
EmbedCreateSpec embed = EmbedCreateSpec.builder()
    .color(Color.BLUE)
    .title("Title")
    .url("https://discord4j.com")
    .author("Some Name", "https://discord4j.com", "https://i.imgur.com/F9BhEoz.png")
    .description("a description")
    .thumbnail("https://i.imgur.com/F9BhEoz.png")
    .addField("field title", "value", false)
    .addField("\u200B", "\u200B", false)
    .addField("inline field", "value", true)
    .addField("inline field", "value", true)
    .addField("inline field", "value", true)
    .image("https://i.imgur.com/F9BhEoz.png")
    .timestamp(Instant.now())
    .footer("footer", "https://i.imgur.com/F9BhEoz.png")
    .build();

client.getChannelById(Snowflake.of(CHANNEL_ID))
    .ofType(GuildMessageChannel.class)
    .flatMap(channel -> channel.createMessage(embed))
    .subscribe();
```

Embeds can also be sent when the message contains content:

```java
client.getChannelById(channelId)
    .ofType(GuildMessageChannel.class)
    .flatMap(channel -> channel.createMessage(MessageCreateSpec.builder()
        .content("A meaningful quote from a good movie")
        .addEmbed(embed)
        .build()
    )).subscribe();
```

:::tip
All embed properties are optional. If you want a simpler embed, you can leave out what you don't want.

### Embed Colors

Discord4J uses a custom `Color` class when a color param is needed. But, you may want more color choices than the default enum provides.

```java
Color rgbColor = Color.of(rr, gg, bb);

Color hexColor = Color.of(0xAABBCC);
```

### Blank Fields

Discord enforces that embed fields and their values contain characters. However, you can "bypass" this restriction by using a zero-width space. To use a ZWS, just use `"\u200B"` as shown in the example above.

## Attaching Images

Like other messages, images can be directly attached to the message and the embed can use the image from the attachment.

Using `attachment://filename.extension` as the image URL, an embed can reference the image attached.

:::tip
If you plan on attaching the same image many times, consider hosting it online and providing the URL to it.

This helps reduce your bandwidth and increase bot response time as you no longer need to upload the image every time its embedded.
:::

```java
EmbedCreateSpec embed = EmbedCreateSpec.builder()
    ...
    .image("attachment://file-name.png")
    .build();

client.getChannelById(channelId)
    .ofType(GuildMessageChannel.class)
    .flatMap(channel -> channel.createMessage(MessageCreateSpec.builder()
        .content("content? content")
        .addFile("file-name.png", fileAsInputStream)
        .addEmbed(embed)
        .build()
    )).subscribe();
```

## Quirks and Features

* If you want 2 or more fields side-by-side, they must have `inline: true`
* The timestamp in the footer, like other timestamps across the client, adjusts to the user's locale
* Mentions will only render correctly in the description and field values.
* Mentions in embeds will not ping users
* Embeds allow markdown. Field values and description support markdown links.

However, there are some limitations to embeds
* Titles are limited to `256` characters
* Descriptions are limited to `4096` characters
* Each embed can have up to `25` fields
* A field's name is limited to `256` characters and its value to `1024` characters
* The footer is limited to `2048` characters
* The author name is limited to `256` characters
* Up to `10` embeds can be included in a single message
* The total length (of the raw json) of all embeds in a message cannot exceed `6000` characters

And the biggest thing to remember:
Embeds are rendered client-side and as such, may look different screen-to-screen depending on screen size.

It's always a good idea to plan out and test how your embeds look on desktop and mobile screens.
